# Algorithms
This repo contains implementation of various algorithms that I have learned and found worth keeping them. 

`Each of file contains the all questions related to one concept and having some variation.`

- ### 0/1 knapsack
        1. Subset Sum
        2. Equal Sum Partition
        3. Count of Subset sum
        4. Minimum Subset Sum Diff
        5. Number of subset with given difference
        6. Target Sum by assigning +/- operators

- ### Unbounded knapsack
        1. Rod cutting Problem.
        2. Coin change, Maximum number of coins to get given sum.
        3. Coin change, Minimum number of coins to get given sum.

- ### Longest Common Subsequence
        1. Print LCS
        2. Largest Pallindromic Subsequence
        3. Subsequence Pattern Matching | Check whether given string "a" is subseqence of "b" or not
        4. Min number of insertion and deletion to make string a == string b.
        5. Min number of deletion in a string to make it a pallindrome.
        6. Min number of insertion in a string to make it a pallindrome.
        7. Length Shortest Common SuperSequence
        8. Print SCS
        9. Largest common Substring
        10. Largest repeating subsequence
        11. Length of largest subsequence of a which is a substring is b.
        12. Count How many times a appear as subsequence in b.
        13. Largest Pallindromic Substring
        14. Count Pallindromic Substring

- ### Martix Chain Multiplication aka MCM
        1. Print MCM 
        2. Evaluate Expression to True or Boolean Parenthesis
        3. Min/Max value of an expression
        4. Pallindrome Partitioning
        5. Scramble string
        6. Egg Droping Problem
